Sometimes the best solution requires us to use more than one teleport. In this case, the optimal solution looks as follows:
Using jumps, travel to (3,10).
Use the first teleport.
Using jumps, travel from (5200,4900) to (5203,4845).
Use the third teleport.
Using jumps, travel from (12200,8701) to (12212,8699).
Use the second teleport.
Using jumps, travel from (9999,30011) to (10000,30000).
