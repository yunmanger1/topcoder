Expected:
50.0
The rock's first destination is always the first space. It has a 50% chance of skipping to the second space, and a 50% chance of skipping to the third space. For the second skip, the maximum distance is 1, which means it has a 100% chance of moving ahead one space. The 50% chance that skipped to the second space now skips to the third space, and gracefully sinks. The 50% chance that skipped to the third space now skips to the fourth space and lands on the pad. Therefore, the rock has a 50% chance of surviving the pads.
