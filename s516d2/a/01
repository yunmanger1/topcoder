"?xo?"
Expected:
"oxox"
Consider the first two characters of message. Since it's a contiguous substring of the input message and has a length of 2, which is even, and since it already contains one 'x', the first '?' must be 'o'. Then, by considering the entire message as a contiguous substring of length 4, the last character must be 'x'.
